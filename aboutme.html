        <p>
            I'm an infosec analyst of almost 10 years working with both blue team and red team technologies. This is my private blog containing write-ups of CTF challenges I've done, OSINT challenges and anything else I find interesting.

				<p>I sometimes do bug bounty and have had a couple of paying bugs over the years. I am Hacker rank over at HackTheBox. During my time in infosec I've picked up a few certs, including OSCP and CISSP. I'm currently studying for OSWE.

						Remember, infosec isn't so much as a job of a passion - never stop learning!
